# JS Encryption App

By Gabe Khofri

Based off a great tutorial at: http://tutorialzine.com/2013/11/javascript-file-encrypter/
Uses AES encryption by cryptojs: https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/

Uses client side JavaScript for file encryption. You upload a file, then choose a password. Then download the encrypted
file. Once the file has downloaded, you click the upload button to decrypt. It will ask you for your password that you
set initially when uploading the file.
